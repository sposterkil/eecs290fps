Introduction:
For our Maze project, we decided to create a space survival horror themed game.Overall, we feel that we were able to complete all of the basic programming requirements suggested by the assignment and more. of particular note for our game is unique space theme we were able to create, and its effective contribution to the atmosphere of the game. Additionally, the overall atmosphere of the game really worked out well, as the game feels sufficiently tense and surprising given the tools that were available to us. We're particularly proud of our AI movement, animations, and weapon pick-ups, as they were probably the most challenging programming aspect of our projects. However, our most difficult obstacle to overcome was the simple logistics of coordinating all the different aspects of the project. Many of us were completely new to Github and file repositories and so we spent a large amount of time simply dealing with merge conflicts and learning the basics of file sharing instead of spending time directly improving our game.
